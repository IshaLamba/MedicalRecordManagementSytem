<center><b>We're on a mission to help mankind live healthier, longer.</b></center><br>
Every day billions of people struggle for better healthcare. We want to change that. Globally.<br>
This starts with helping them find the best doctors and culminates into a single intelligent healthcare account for the entire family that securely stores all their healthcare data so they can make better healthcare decisions.
<br><br><center><b>Rules Are For Fools, We're Driven By Values</b></center><br>
We believe values are more important than rules. At Doctor Lounge our values are not just principles for our products or our company but they in many ways define who we are as people. Foremost amongst our values is do-great. Do great is our belief that whatever we do, we must always do it the best. That good is not good enough. That our desire for excellence stems not from want of rewards or recognitions but from the sky high expectations we have of us.<br>
<br><br>Everyday, we work on problems no one has dared to solve before. We're dreamers, thinkers and do-ers all rolled into one. We have audaciously, galactically big dreams - because that's what it takes to truly change the world and improve healthcare access for humanity.
